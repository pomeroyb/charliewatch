ChuckWatch
-----
This is a version of [OSResearch's excellent CharlieWatch](https://github.com/osresearch/charliewatch) with a bit more functionality. It adds an [LIS3DH](https://www.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/document/datasheet/3c/ae/50/85/d6/b1/46/fe/CD00274221.pdf/files/CD00274221.pdf/jcr:content/translations/en.CD00274221.pdf) accelerometer. This will eventually allow the watch to respond to taps, opening up possibilities for interaction and setting of time.


Original README
------

![Watch rendering](watch.png)

"Analog" watch with 60+12 Charlieplexed LEDs. Based on Travis Goodspeed's
GoodWatch21 schematic, using the CC430F5137IRGZR CPU, which doesn't
have the LCD controller of the CC430F6xxx in the GoodWatch. There are
also pads for a six pin EZfet cable with pogopins for programming or
serial communication.

![v0.2 board, populated](images/v0.2.jpg)
v0.2 works, although it has no radio parts.  It is exactly 1 square inch
of PCB and should fit in a 38mm or 36mm case.


![v0.1 board](images/v0.1.jpg)
v0.1 works, although the radio parts have not been tested.  It is a slightly
larger board and fits in a 40mm case.

Programming cable
-----

From the top of the v0.1 board:
* RST / TDIO
* RXD on programmer
* TXD on programmer
* VCC
* TST / TCK
* GND

v0.2:
* greem
* white
* blue
* purple
* gray
* black


There is also a four-wire setup that might simplify the wiring.
Travis documents it and the power consumption here:

Bricked Launchpad
-----

If you brick your launchpad by running Energia under Linux, it will no
longer program the Charliewatch.  The other weirdness is that `tilib`
can detect the device, but can't write to it unless run as root.

Energy Trace
----
* `libmsp430.so`: https://dlbeer.co.nz/articles/slac460y/index.html
* https://github.com/carrotIndustries/energytrace-util
* Have to update path to `MSP430.h` from the `slac/DLL430_v3/include` directory
